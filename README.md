AWS Account
- Sign up for AWS account. You will have to enter your credit card information and name and address. For small projects, your usage will hopefully remain under the Free Tier limits and you will not receive charges.
- As part of the account creation: 
    - You will create and name a bucket. 
    - You will select a region. Each region is associated with a region code. Those codes can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html. Copy the region code associated with the region you selected.
    - You will also obtain an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
- You will use the bucket name, region code, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key as credentials to configure S3 in your server.
